      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          On March 4, the federal government announced that 440 federal buildings could be sold.
          Officials argued that taxpayers shouldn’t have to cover the cost of “empty and underutilized office space.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That reasoning didn’t hold up. Many of the buildings on the list weren’t empty at all. 
          They were being used—just not by the people or groups the administration seemed to prioritize.
        </p>

        <h3>What’s at Stake</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most alarming names on the list was the <strong>Freedom Rides Museum</strong> in Montgomery, Alabama. 
          The museum sits inside the historic Greyhound bus station where Freedom Riders were attacked in 1961 for challenging segregation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the site stands as both a memorial and an educational center, teaching new generations about the courage it took to fight racial injustice. 
          Putting it on a list of “unnecessary” buildings wasn’t just an oversight—it sent a message that this history could be discarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other buildings tied to civil rights leaders were also targeted, raising questions about whether this was truly about saving money 
          or about sidelining certain parts of American history.

        <h3>Political Response</h3>
        <p>
          Representatives <strong>Terri Sewell</strong> and <strong>Shomari Figures</strong> fought back against the decision. 
          Their efforts eventually got the museum removed from the sale list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, it didn’t happen overnight. The long delay before the museum was declared safe left many wondering how “essential” 
          the government really considers preserving civil rights landmarks.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          The Freedom Rides Museum is safe for now, but the fact that it was ever in danger is telling. 
          This isn’t just about one building—it’s about what stories we choose to protect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fight over the museum is a reminder that history isn’t just about the past. 
          It’s about what we carry forward. And deciding what to preserve says a lot about what kind of future we’re building.
